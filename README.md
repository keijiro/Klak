System Requirements
-------------------

Unity 5.1 or later versions.

*Kvant* effects require floating-point HDR textures to store animation state.
Most of the mobile devices don't fulfill this requirement at the moment.

No Backward Compatibility
-------------------------

This version (v2) is not compatible with the previous versions. You can't simply
upgrade the previous implementation or use two different versions in the same
project. Sorry for the inconvenience!
